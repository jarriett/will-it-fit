Have you ever wondered what the optimal rotation of a piece of furniture is so you can get it through a doorway?
Turns out there is a way to know this and its a computational geometry technique known as rotating calipers. This 
project attempts to apply the technique of rotating calipers to the convex hull of an arbitrary shape in order to
align the perpendicular of a polygons width with a given axis.
